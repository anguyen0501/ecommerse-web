- Promotions and technology news sections
- Admin panel for managing products and users

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of all pages
- **CSS3**: Custom styles for layout and design (no frameworks detected)
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For interactivity, form validation, and dynamic content
- **Font Awesome**: For icons (via CDN)
- **Responsive Design**: Uses meta viewport and flexible layouts

### Backend
